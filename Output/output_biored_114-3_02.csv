CRBN c.2113_2114delGG causes a V311fs frameshift that reduces cereblon protein stability and impairs lenalidomide binding in multiple myeloma cells.,-30.75,0.2,sequencevariant
"CRIM1 c.2113_2114delGG causes a frameshift (V311fs) that abolishes the extracellular calcium‑binding domain, leading to impaired bone mineralization in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta.",-36.25,0.2,sequencevariant
"V311fs, a frameshift variant caused by the deletion of nucleotides c.2113_2114delGG, disrupts the TP53 protein’s DNA‑binding domain and is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness in Homo sapiens.",-32.5,0.2,sequencevariant
Varying the sequence variant c.2113_2114delGG in the TP53 gene leads to a frameshift that reduces the stability of the p53 protein and increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer in patients of the Homo sapiens population.,-37.75,0.2,sequencevariant
"Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) harboring the c.2113_2114delGG sequence variant exhibits a markedly reduced binding affinity for its receptor FLT1, thereby attenuating angiogenic signaling in human endothelial cells.",-30.375,0.2,sequencevariant
